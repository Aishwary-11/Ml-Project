Algorithm Used: Random Forest Regressor
Reason: 
- Random Forest is a robust and flexible ensemble learning method that improves prediction accuracy by averaging the results of multiple decision trees.
- It handles non-linear relationships well and reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees.
- Suitable for regression tasks where predicting continuous values, such as traffic volume, is required.

Ensemble Model for Traffic Volume Prediction
Algorithm Used: Voting Regressor (combining Random Forest and XGBoost)
Reason:
- An ensemble model combines multiple algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
- Random Forest provides stability and reduces overfitting, while XGBoost is known for its high performance and efficiency in handling large datasets.
- The combination leverages the strengths of both models, providing better overall predictions.

- Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection
Algorithm Used: Isolation Forest
Reason: 
- Isolation Forest is specifically designed for anomaly detection, isolating anomalies by creating partitions in the data.
- It is efficient and scales well with large datasets, making it suitable for detecting outliers in traffic volume data.


One-Class SVM Anomaly Detection

Algorithm Used: One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine)
Reason: 
- One-Class SVM is effective for anomaly detection by learning a decision function for the classification of data points as normal or anomalous.
- It is useful when the dataset contains only one class (normal data) and anomalies are rare or unknown.
- It provides a clear boundary for identifying outliers in the traffic volume data.

Decision Tree Traffic Condition Prediction
Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier

Reason: 
- Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them suitable for classification tasks.
- They can handle both categorical and numerical data, providing flexibility in feature selection.
- They are capable of capturing complex decision boundaries, making them useful for predicting traffic conditions (high or low traffic volume).

Enhanced Decision Tree Traffic Condition Prediction with Date
Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier (enhanced with date information)
Reason: 
- Decision Trees, with additional date features, can capture temporal patterns and seasonality in the data.
- Including day and month information helps improve the accuracy of predictions by considering the temporal context.
- The enhanced model provides better insights into traffic conditions by accounting for time-related variations.
